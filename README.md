# evd-transmission-trees
 
This repository contains the code to reproduce the analysis presented in the paper: 
> Alexis Robert, Joseph Tsui Lok Hei, Conall H Watson et al, 
> *Quantifying the added value of viral genomics to infer who infected whom in the 2014-16 Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea*

The main script of the repository (`src/main_script.R`) is used to generate simulated transmission trees (using the functions contained in `src/function_generate_outbreaks.R`), and analyse them using Outbreaker2. Finally, the main script generates the different figures included in the paper (using the functions contained in `src/function_figures`).
